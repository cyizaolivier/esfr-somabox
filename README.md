# LMS App (UI prototype)

This is a minimal Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS scaffold for an LMS UI prototype.

Quick start:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Pages:

- `/signin` - Sign in UI (no Google sign-in button)
- `/signup` - Sign up UI (no Google sign-up button)
- `/dashboard` - Mock dashboard (requires sign in)

Notes:

- This is a UI-only mock with a simple in-memory auth provider (`src/auth.tsx`).
- Replace pages with your designs; upload images and I will adapt the components accordingly.
